                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Transforming Education In India</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all
                rural children between the ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to
                report enrollment above 96%. India has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this
                age group from year 2007 to 2014. As an outcome the number of students in the age group 6-14 who are not
                enrolled in school has come down to 2.8% in the year academic year 2018 (ASER 2018).[11] Another report
                from 2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural
                schools of India, from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 2.3 million students over 2002 total
                enrolment, and a 19% increase in girl's enrolment.[12] While quantitatively India is inching closer to
                universal education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run
                school system. While more than 95 percent of children attend primary school, just 40 percent of Indian
                adolescents attend secondary school (Grades 9-12). Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2
                billion to education in India. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of
                teachers every day.[13] States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to
                identify and improve such schools.[14]</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated
                in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any
                accredited educational institution) and all other aspects of operation. Hence, the differentiation of
                government schools and private schools can be misleading.[15]

                In January 2019, India had over 900 universities and 40,000 colleges.[16] In India's higher education
                system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the
                historically disadvantaged Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. In
                universities, colleges, and similar institutions affiliated to the federal government, there is a
                maximum 50% of reservations applicable to these disadvantaged groups, at the state level it can vary.
                Maharashtra had 73% reservation in 2014, which is the highest percentage of reservations in
                India.[17][18][19][20]</p>
